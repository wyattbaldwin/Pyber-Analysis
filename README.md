# Pyber-Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this analysis of Pyber, a ride share company, was to provide insights to help the business grow and increase profitability in underperforming areas. The data used included the number of drivers in each city, the classification of cities as urban, suburban, or rural, and fares for rides taken between January and May 2019.
  
  ## Results
  
The majority of the analysis was conducted at the city type level. The results showed that:
  
  * The average number of rides was higher in urban and suburban cities compared to rural cities.
  
  * The average fare per ride was also higher in urban and suburban cities compared to rural cities.
  
  * A larger percentage of total fares came from urban cities.
    
  * The total fare by city type by week demonstrated that urban and rural cities had higher profits in the month of March, while suburban cities had lower earnings and fewer rides.
   
  * The total number of drivers in urban and suburban cities was higher than in rural cities.
   
   ## Conclusion and Recommendations
   
   Based on the analysis and the results obtained, the following recommendations were made to improve profitability and expand the business:
   
  * Increase the number of drivers in rural cities to increase the number of rides and make Pyber more affordable in those areas.

  * Move some drivers from suburban to urban and rural cities to boost profits and driver morale.

  * Consider ride share programs in rural cities where many residents have lower incomes.

By implementing these recommendations, Pyber can grow and become more successful.
